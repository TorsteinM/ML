# Image => Text Detection => Character Segmentation => Char Recognition


# 1. Text Detection:
# Technique: Sliding Windows
# 1.1. Use supervised learning on sliding windows.
# 1.2. Expand probable windows.
# 1.3. Export the corresponding image data to character segmentation.

# 2. Character segmentation:
# 2.1. Sliding windows
# 2.2. Find character
# 2.3. Continue until. If another character is found, note edge and continue.

# 3. Character Recognition:
# 3.1. Use real data and synthetic data.
# 3.2.
